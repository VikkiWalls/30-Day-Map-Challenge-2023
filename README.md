This is my second year doing this challenge! You can check out last years repo [here](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022). This year I'm having to do this alongside a full time job so I have no idea how it will go timings wise but I'll be attempting every map anyway.
You can find all my code here in this repo, but feel free to follow my progress on my socials:

#### Notes:
* Goal was for map to achieves something that looked reasonably good quite quickly as I was already a couple of days behind on the challenge when I made it.
* I re used the Mapbox Studio base map I hand built for last year's colour Friday [(Blue)](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022#colour-friday-blue) map.

This is my second year doing this challenge! You can check out last years repo [here](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022). This year I'm having to do this alongside a full time job so I have no idea how it will go timings wise but I'll be attempting every map anyway.
You can find all my code here in this repo, but feel free to follow my progress on my socials:

#### Notes:
* Goal was for map to achieves something that looked reasonably good quite quickly as I was already a couple of days behind on the challenge when I made it.
* I re used the Mapbox Studio base map I hand built for last year's colour Friday [(Blue)](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022#colour-friday-blue) map.

4. ### A Bad Map
![Bad Map](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2023/blob/main/Map%20Images/Day%204.png?raw=true "Day 4 - A Bad Map")

#### Plan:
Map the locations of all the mass shootings in the USA in 2023.

#### Key Skills/Technologies used:
* Python
    * Os
    * Pandas
    * Matplotlib
    * Plotly

#### Code and Data:
[Code](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2023/blob/main/Code/Day%204.ipynb)
[Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2023#cite_note-272)

#### Notes:
I wanted to flip around the idea of a bad map. 
Instead of a map which dosen't do it's job, or a map that looks a bit rubbish, I thought it would be an interesting change to do a map about a bad thing. 
So this map illustrates all the locations where there have been mass shootings in the United States in 2023. 
Devastatingly, at the time of producing this map, there have been 518.

#### Plan:
Draw a map of Asia on a Pumpkin

#### Notes:
Thought it would be amusing to use up a leftover Haloween pumpkin and fancied challenging myself to draw Asia given there are lots of interestingly shaped countries in the region.

6. ### Asia

#### Plan:
Illustrate the difference in tourism revenue between the different provences in Thailand

#### Code and Data:

#### Key Skills/Technologies used:

    * Os

7. ### Navigation
![Nav Map](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2023/blob/main/Map%20Images/Day%207.png?raw=true "Day 7 - Navigation Map")

#### Plan:
Show you the way to Amarillo (from New York where the writers of the hit were based at the time)

#### Code and Data:
[Code](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2023/blob/main/Code/Day%207.ipynb)

#### Key Skills/Technologies used:
* Python
    * Os
    * Pandas
    * Matplotlib
    * Plotly

#### Notes:
I initially tried using follium for this but had a lot of issues.
Instead I had to use google to find the route and then manually harvest the co-ordinates so I could plot them on the map.
I also built a mapbox style from scratch in the colour scheme used by the song's original almbum cover but for some reason plotly wasn't showing the location lables so I had to go with the standard mapbox v11 dark mode style instead.
Overall felt pretty frustrated by this map because I was very excited by the idea, and not only does the route look pretty boring, but the overall look of the map does not at all reflect the effort that went into it.
It's also pretty frustrating that this map has put me even further behind than I was in the challenge, and it looks really pretty basic and boring for my trouble.

[CFC Data](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Environment/CFC/Consumption#)

#### Notes:
Very much an art focused rather than scientific focused map.
Used Paint to add the retro visuals and the font used was Jokerman.
Some of the data for countries didn't join properly - some of this was due to accesnts in the names in the geospatial data but there were other occasions which I could not solve.

#### Notes:
* Inspired by last year's lines [map](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022#lines)
Really struggled with todays theme, I had several really cool ideas but there was either no data, no information on how to achieve the idea, or no time.
Beware of the data, that file is a monster, it took ages to run just the import statement!
